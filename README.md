Hi there! I'm Chike Egbuniwe, an IT Operations professional.
I'm passionate about cloud technologies and actively expanding my skills in Microsoft Azure. I've completed the AZ-900 certification and am now diving deeper into hands-on labs and preparing for AZ-104.
I enjoy building and experimenting with cloud infrastructure, automation, and DevOps tools. This space is where I share my learning journey, personal projects, and open-source contributions.
